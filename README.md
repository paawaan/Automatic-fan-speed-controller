# Automatic fan speed controller

The main idea of this project has been taken from the smart home 
setup that are so popular nowadays. A temperature sensor has been 
used to sense the temperature dynamically, when temperature of the
surrounding increases the fan speed is increased and when temperature 
decreases, the fan speed is decreased. Basically, the change in 
temperature read from the sensor is directly proportional to change 
in speed of fan.
